# Overview
Tested On:
* Nano/ServerCore RTM

# Scope
This build was initially grabbed from https://github.com/DarwinJS/ChocoPackages/tree/master/openssh because of its handling of OpenSSH

# Territory
This build is under development to host X-Windows sessions from the container using mostly Chocolatey modules

# Alpha
As this is a rewrite from a crude albeit functioning X-POC that was hosted as a blob only, therefore a Dockerfile rewrite was in place

# Reason to exist
Because Windows, even containers, need a GUI even when it's a crude one IMHO
